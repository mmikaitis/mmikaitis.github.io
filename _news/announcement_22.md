M. Fasi and me have recently organized a minisymposium at ICIAM 2023 in Tokyo, on the topics of randomized floating-point rounding and reduced precision. Summary and slides are available in a new [blog post](https://nla-group.org/2023/10/02/iciam-2023-minisymposium-on-stochastic-rounding-for-reduced-precision-arithmetic-in-scientific-computing/). We are grateful to Xiaobo Liu for chairing.
