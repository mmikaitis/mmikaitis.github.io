As part of SIAM PP22 conference (23-26 February), Nick Higham and me coorganized a minisymposium on understanding and exploiting matrix arithmetic hardware operations widely available in today's supercomputers. Abstracts and slides of the talks are [available](https://nla-group.org/2022/02/28/siam-pp22-minisymposium-on-understanding-and-exploiting-mixed-precision-accelerators-for-high-performance-computing/).
