I am a Lecturer in the [School of Computer Science](https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/computing) at the University of Leeds. Before this I was a Research Associate with the [Numerical Linear Algebra Group](https://nla-group.org) at the University of Manchester, working with [Professor Nicholas J. Higham](https://nhigham.com). I received a B.Sc. (Hons.) degree in Computer Science in 2016 and a PhD degree in Computer Science in 2020 (supervised by Dr David Lester and Professor Steve Furber), both from the University of Manchester.

My research interests include: computer arithmetic, numerical linear algebra, high-performance computing, mathematical software, performance optimization and benchmarking.
